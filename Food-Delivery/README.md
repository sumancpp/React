# 🍔 Food Delivery Website  

I built a simple **Food Delivery Website** using **React.js** 🚀.  
It started as practice but I kept adding cool features along the way:  

- 👉 Category-based food filtering  
- 🛒 Dynamic Cart (add/remove items)  
- ✅ Toast notifications for actions (like add to cart, place order)  
- 🎨 Clean UI with TailwindCSS  
- 🔄 State management using Redux & Context  
- 📱 Fully responsive design  

Still planning to add more features like authentication, backend integration & payments 👀
